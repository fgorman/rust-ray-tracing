### Why I'm doing this

Starting to learn how to do some graphical rendering for a game engine and figured this is a good place to start getting deeper learning in rendering and the math required for it.

### How to build and run

#### Build:

`cargo build`

#### Run:

`cargo run -- <output_file_name>.ppm <picture_width> <aspect_ratio_numerator> <aspect_ratio_denominator>`
